# La Porta VR 🚪🍄

A virtual reality application developed for Oculus that explores the psychedelic experience in an educational and immersive context.

🎮 **[Play on itch.io](https://laportavr.itch.io/laporta)**

## Concept

La Porta is an application developed for Oculus that attempts to partially replicate the psychedelic experience, following the ingestion of "magic" mushrooms. The user will also have the opportunity to learn more about the history, controversies and effects of psychedelics in a fun and new way, guided by a friend in what looks just like a normal room.

## Objective

The application greatly takes advantage of the immersion provided by Oculus, not only to translate into virtual reality some of the effects provided by the ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms, but also to dispense bite-size information about these substances, which often suffer from stigma caused by the lack of knowledge about them. The room in which the user is free to move is filled with references to psychedelic-related media, such as books, music CDs/LPs and movie posters. Our main intent is to stimulate the curiosity of the users, offering them a "door" to the world of this intriguing topic.
